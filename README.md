Geographer is a PHP library that knows how any country, state or city is called in any language. [Documentation on the official website](https://geographer.su/documentation/php/)

Includes integrations with: Laravel 5, Lumen 5

## Dependencies

* PHP >= 5.5

## Installation via Composer

To install simply run:

```
$ composer require menarasolutions/geographer
```

Or add it to `composer.json` manually:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "menarasolutions/geographer": "~0.3"
    }
}
```

This, main package is shipped with English language so add extra dependencies for your
other languages, eg.:

```
$ composer require menarasolutions/geographer-es
```

## Usage

```php
use MenaraSolutions\Geographer\Earth;
use MenaraSolutions\Geographer\Country;

// Default entry point is our beautiful planet
$earth = new Earth();

// Give me a list of all countries please
$earth->getCountries()->toArray();

// Oh, but please try to use short versions, eg. USA instead of United States of America
$earth->getCountries()->useShortNames()->toArray();

// Now please give me all states of Thailand
$thailand = $earth->getCountries()->findOne(['code' => 'TH']); // You can call find on collection
$thailand = $earth->findOne(['code' => 'TH']); // Or right away on division
$thailand = $earth->findOneByCode('TH'); // Alternative shorter syntax
$thailand = Country::build('TH'); // You can build a country object directly, too
$thailand->getStates()->toArray();

// Oh, but I want them in Russian
$thailand->getStates()->setLocale('ru')->toArray();

// Oh, but I want them inflicted to 'in' form (eg. 'in Spain')
$thailand->getStates()->setLocale('ru')->inflict('in')->toArray();

// Or if you prefer constants for the sake of IDE auto-complete
$thailand->getStates()->setLocale(TranslationAgency::LANG_RUSSIAN)->inflict(TranslationAgency::FORM_IN)->toArray();

// What's the capital and do you have a geonames ID for that? Or maybe latitude and longitude?
$capital = $thailand->getCapital();
$capital->getGeonamesCode();
$capital->getLatitude();
$capital->getLongitude();
```

## Collections

Arrays of administrative divisions (countries, states or cities) are returned as collections – a modern
way of implementing arrays. Some of the available methods are:

```php
$states->sortBy('name'); // States will be sorted by name
$states->setLocale('ru')->sortBy('name'); // States will be sorted by Russian translations/names
$states->find(['code' => 472039]); // Find 1+ divisions that match specified parameters 
$states->findOne(['code' => 472039]); // Return the first match only
$states->findOneByCode(472039); // Convenience magic method
$states->toArray(); // Return a flat array of states
$states->pluck('name'); // Return a flat array of state names
```

## Common methods on division objects

All objects can do the following:
```php
$object->toArray(); // Return a flat array with all data
$object->parent(); // Return a parent (city returns a state, state returns a country)
$object->getCode(); // Get default unique ID
$object->getShortName(); // Get short (colloquial) name of the object
$object->getLongName(); // Get longer name
$object->getCodes(); // Get a plain array of all available unique codes
```

You can access information in a number of ways, do whatever you are comfortable with:
```php
$object->getName(); // Get object's name (inflicted and shortened when necessary)
$object->name; // Same effect
$object['name']; // Same effect
$object->toArray()['name']; // Same effect again
```

## Subdivision standards

By default, we will use ISO-3166-1 country and ISO 3166-2 state classification. Therefore, countries or states that don't have ISO codes are not visible by default.
Please note that FIPS 10-4 is a deprecated (abandoned) standard. It's better not to rely on it – new states and/or countries won't appear in FIPS.

You can change subdivision standard with ```setStandard``` method:

```php
$country->setStandard(DefaultManager::STANDARD_ISO); // ISO subdivisions
$country->setStandard(DefaultManager::STANDARD_FIPS); // FIPS 10-4 subdivisions
$country->setStandard(DefaultManager::STANDARD_GEONAMES); // Geonames subdivisions
```

This will affect ```getStates()``` and ```getCountries()``` output.

## Earth API

Earth object got the following convenience methods:
```php
$earth->getAfrica(); // Get a collection of African countries
$earth->getEurope(); // Get a collection of European countries
$earth->getNorthAmerica(); // You can guess
$earth->getSouthAmerica(); 
$earth->getAsia();
$earth->getOceania();

$earth->getCountries(); // A collection of all countries
$earth->withoutMicro(); // Only countries that have population of at least 100,000
```

By default, we will use ISO 3166-1 country classification.

## Country API

Country objects got the following encapsulated data:
```php
$country->getCode(); //ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (2 character) code
$country->getCode3(); // ISO 3166-1 alpha-3
$country->getNumericCode(); // ISO 3166-1 numeric code
$country->getGeonamesCode(); // Geonames ID
$country->getFipsCode(); // FIPS code
$country->getArea(); // Area in square kilometers
$country->getCurrencyCode(); // National currency, eg. USD
$country->getPhonePrefix(); // Phone code, eg. 7 for Russia
$country->getPopulation(); // Population
$country->getLanguage(); // Country's first official language

$country->getStates(); // A collection of all states
$country->getCities(); // A collection of all cities. It only returns an array for the moment.
Country::build('TH'); // Build a country object based on ISO code
```

Geonames, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, alpha-3 and numeric codes are four viable options to reference country in your data store.

## State API

At this moment Geographer only keeps cities with population above 50,000 for the sake of performance.

```php
$state->getCode(); // Get default code (currently Geonames)
$state->getIsoCode(); // Get ISO 3166-2 code  
$state->getFipsCode(); // Get FIPS code
$state->getGeonamesCode(); // Get Geonames code

$state->getCities(); // A collection of all cities
$state = State::build($id); // Instantiate a state directly, based on $id provided (Geonames or ISO)
```

Geonames, ISO 3166-2 and FIPS are all unique codes so all three can be used to reference states in your data store.

## City API

```php
$city->getCode(); // This is always a Geonames code for now
$city = City::build($id); // Instantiate a city directly, based on $id provided (Geonames) 
$city->getLatitude(); // City's latitude
$city->getLongitude(); // City's longitude
$city->getPopulation(); // Population
```

Geonames ID is currently the only viable option to reference a city in your data store. 

## Integrations with frameworks

[Official Laravel package](https://github.com/MenaraSolutions/geographer-laravel)

## Current coverage: subdivisions

| Type | ISO 3166 | FIPS | Geonames | GENC |
|------|----------|------|----------|------|
| Countries | 100% | Coming soon | 100% | TBC |
| States | 100% | Coming soon | 100% | TBC |

Subdivision data is kept in a separate repo - [geographer-data](https://github.com/MenaraSolutions/geographer-data) so that it 
may be reused by different language SDKs. 

## Current coverage: translations

By default Geographer assumes that you use Packagist (Composer) to install language packages, therefore
we will expect them in vendor/ folder. There is no need to manually turn on an extra language, but if you
attempt to use a non-existing language – expect an exception.

English texts are included in the data package and are used as default metadata. 

## Vision

Our main principles and goals are:

1. Be lightweight and independent – so that this package can be pulled anywhere alone
2. Coverage – Geographer should cover all countries and languages
3. Be extensible – developers should be able to override and extend easily

## Performance

While not a number one priority at this stage, we will try maintain reasonable CPU and memory performance. Some benchmarks:

**Inflating a city based on its Id**

Time: 6 ms, memory: 81056 bytes

## Video tutorials

I've just started a educational YouTube channel that will cover top IT trends in software development and DevOps: [config.sys](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIvUJ1iVRjJP_xL0CD7cMpg)

## Todo

1. Add a basic spatial index
2. Add some unit tests (in addition to existing integration tests)
3. Add coverage information for language packages
